Structure Tests
-	I reused the same index from the previous assignment, everything rendered in completely fine.
CSS Tests
-   I put in all of the min variables into each selector and it caused the page to act weirdly and appear abnormal whenIi shrunk it. After I only left the body with the minmax information, it did not have an issue.
-   I tried different overflow options to see what would happen, and the one I liked best was the scroll element.
-   After I added all of the padding, I went back and added borders so I could see the padding and spacing elements work in a visual manner.
Responsive Test
-   I was able to change the browser window to all different shapes and sizes and had no issue with content not appearing.
