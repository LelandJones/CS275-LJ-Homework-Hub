1.	What does the <head> section do for this page?

It contains information based on the page, usually at the top of the page in the search bar above.

2.	Why is alt text important—beyond “for screen readers”?

It informs people what the image is supposed to be, in case it fails or the sizing is off, and it breaks. 

3.	What’s the difference between <h1> and just making text large?

I believe there is a difference if you were to look at it semantically, where H1 describes that the text is large, whereas just increasing the font size doesn’t let you describe that it is a large heading.
